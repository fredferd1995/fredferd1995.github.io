Applying for jobs can seem simple at first, but can become a nightmare to track. Some common problems, or questions that I found myself asking, were:
- How can I keep track of jobs that I have applied to?
- What if I want to apply for a specific job at a later date?
- What if a company looks interesting, but does not currently have any relevant job postings for me at this moment?
- Which resume version did I use to apply for this job?
- How far into the process did I get?
- Is there a "cooldown period"?
- Are there any specific notes, or contacts, that I want to keep in mind?
- What if I need to follow up on an action for a specific date?


This seemed like a good opportunity for a personal project. It solves a real problem that I am having, and will allow me to get familiar with some new technologies. 

<!-- ## Requirements
- Persistent storage of job application records
- Should be able to track which specific resume was used, for future reference
