## Experience
#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) - [OpsCenter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter.html)
*Software Development Engineer*
    
- Empowered OpsCenter customers (56K active WoW) to increase security posture by designing/coding attribute‑based access control service.
    - Integrated with AWS Identity service, allowing customers to scope resource access based on resource metadata.
    - __End Result__: Customers are able to scope access to operational items based on "context keys".
- Migrated 13 internal/external APIs from manual to automated __python__/__boto3__ security testing framework, bringing coverage to 100%.
    - __End Result__: Improved team development velocity from months to weeks by leveraging this immediate automated security coverage.
- Implemented custom alarms, metrics, logging, and dashboards to monitor new feature adoption and health. 
    - __End Result__: Logging and runbook additions helped bring on‑call MTTR down to minutes from hours, saving time, money and customer impact.
- Wrote code, tests on 4 dev team for design, implementation of feature to support cross‑account resource access.
    - __End Result__: Reduced latency on calls to AWS Organizations API, saving up to 30s in some cases.
- Authored design documents and drove team consensus on new feature design and implementation.



#### Lockheed Martin, Santa Barbara Focalplane
*Infrared Imaging Systems Engineer*

- Technical Lead on largest infrared camera contract for site. Regularly worked with partner teams and customers in multiple US locations.
- Led technical projects, 4 technicians, 2 test engineers. Managed budget. Researched, documented, communicated technical details, and defended proposals, analysis to site leadership.
- Implemented simulation of upstream image‑processing suite, extensible to different types of imagery data. Software enabled validation/introduction of new detector design.
    - __End Result__: Obsoleted need for additional in‑flight testing and validation, saving months of planning and thousands of dollars.
- Performed statistical analysis on infrared camera data (MATLAB, Python), which informed process changes, reduced failure modes, improved yield.
    - __End Result__: Cases include complete reduction of infant mortality failure mode, and improvements in detector yield by up to 50% in some runs.
- Developed, released production software to test camera systems and measure performance against requirements.
